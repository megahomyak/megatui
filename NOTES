=== IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

Turns out I *have* to use ncurses. Crap. I thought the standard library - maybe with some POSIX extensions - will solve the problem, but frick me, I guess, have to bring in a dependency (eugh!)

Every character has a type: it's either static, editable or a button. Button cells should also store an arbitrary index in themselves, this is to recognize what button got pressed

=== UI ===

At least one cell per screen so there will be at least something to stand on. Cursor stands on cells, like in Vim, not between cells, like in Windows 7 built-in Notepad. Cursor can't go beyond cells

Empty editable fields should be implemented via one space character cell marked as "editable" - this is to make editable fields visible when they're empty and allow to enter text after the last character. Theoretically, one can use anything else instead of a space, but it will look confusing then

Apart from that one space at the end of an editable field, there should be no mandatory padding anywhere, e.g. a button can be in such a way that its entire text is its only clickable surface, no one-space paddings around the button text, these paddings can be added by the user if the user desires so

Actions:
* Arrow keys:
    * Move the cursor one screen cell in the specified direction
* Enter/return:
    * When cursor is on button cell:
        * Activate the button
    * When cursor is on editable cell:
        * Insert a "new line" ("\n") editable cell before the current cell
* Any other character:
    * When cursor is on editable cell:
        * Insert that "any other character" as editable cell, before the current cell
